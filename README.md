## Loopstudios landing page

### Junior level - From 11/01/2021 to 16/01/2021

First challenge to build a static site desktop design.
I had 3 difficulties which are the following

- font settings (import font, size, weight, letter-spacing, height interval and horizontal scale)
- manage properly flexbox
- on hover and pseudo-element for the menu
